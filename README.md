# How to implement on your own server

- Copy all files that are in the mods folder into data/mods.
- Copy all files that are in the chat-plugins folder into server/chat-plugins
- Copy whatever is in custom.css into config/custom.css
- Copy whatever is in config/formats.js into config/formats.js wherever you want that section of formats. (Make sure you copy it under the last tier of a section.)
